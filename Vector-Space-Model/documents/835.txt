the problem of strain accumulation under thermal cycling .
parkes and sprague and huang have shown that it is possible for strain
growth to occur in a beam structure under temperature-load cycling .
the various aspects of this problem as to criteria for convergence and
divergence of the strain accumulation can be simply demonstrated by
thermal cycling one element of a two-element structure .
