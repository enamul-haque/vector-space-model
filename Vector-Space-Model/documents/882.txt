.W
the variation of gust frequency with gust velocity
and altitude .
  information on atmospheric turbulence obtained from counting
accelerometer records is examined and relations giving the variation of
gust frequency with gust velocity and altitude are obtained .  the
results are summarized in a form convenient for use in estimating the
fatigue life of an aircraft .
