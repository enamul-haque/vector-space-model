asymptotic solution of the two dimensional oscillating
aerofoil problem for high subsonic mach numbers .
  a new method has been given, for obtaining asymptotic solutions of a
boundary value problem for the wave equation .  the method is simpler
than the method previously given by burger, and leads to a result
identical with burger's result .
