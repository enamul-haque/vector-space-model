the problems of solid blockage, wake blockage, lift effect, and the

detail . corrections are given for various open and closed tunnels,
rectangular, circular and octagonal, and different speeds, two and
three dimensional flows, with several aerofoils and wings . other
interferences include the wall boundary layer, gradient of static
pressure and problems with the working fluid used .
