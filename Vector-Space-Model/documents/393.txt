the shear flow along a flat plate with uniform suction .
  recently, several authors have investigated the boundary
layer in a shear flow .  in this note, an exact solution of the
navier-stokes equations will be presented, which represents the
boundary layer along an infinite flat plate with uniform suction
situated in a shear flow .
