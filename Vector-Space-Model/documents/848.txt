the effect of an internal compressible fluid column
on the breathing vibrations of a thin pressurised cylindrical
shell .
  the free oscillations of a thin pressurized cylindrical shell
containing a compressible fluid are studied here .  the use of an
approximate set of shell equations (shallow shell theory) leads to
a relatively simple formula for the natural frequencies of the
coupled fluid-cylinder system .  the results of some
computations are presented .
