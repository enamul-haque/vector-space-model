general characteristics of the flow through nozzles
at near critical speeds .
  the characteristics of the position and form of
the transition surface through the critical velocity
are computed for flow through flat and round nozzles
from subsonic to supersonic velocity .  corresponding
considerations were carried out for the flow about profiles
in the vicinity of sonic velocity .
