transition form laminar to turbulent shear flow .
  recent experimental studies of transition from laminar to
turbulent shear flows are reviewed .  certain common features
are emphasized and related to the stability theories of viscous
shear layers .  the three-dimensional character, the
unsteadiness, and the nonlinear and random behavior of the latter stages
of the transition process are also examined .
